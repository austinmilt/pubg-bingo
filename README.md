The "seed" in the URL determines the layout of the card. If you want to share a particular layout, just share
the whole URL as is. If you want to generate a different card, either reload the page with no seed, press the
"Gimme a new Card" button, or enter your own seed. The seed can be any combination of letters, numbers, and
many special characters (e.g. hyphens, underscores, etc).
